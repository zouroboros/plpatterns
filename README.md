# plpatterns

A repository of common programming tasks or patterns for many different programming languages.
You can browse the examples directly in the repository or use the [plpatterns.org](https://plpatterns.org)
site.

The repository is organized as follows the patterns folder contains the examples each programming
language has its own folder and each pattern is contained in its own folder e.g.
- `patterns`
    - `Javascript`
        - `hello-world`
    - `Java`
        - `hello-world`
        - `singleton`

The folder of the pattern must contain a `info.md` that contains a description or explanation of the pattern. In addition the folder can contain multiple code files that contain code to use or implement
the pattern.
