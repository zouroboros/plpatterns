# Sum numbers in a list

![sumNumbers.js](sumNumbers.js "Sum numbers in a list")

In order to sum all the variables in we need to iterate over all the numbers and add them to our running sum. In the
above example the variable named `sum` represents our running sum. In the next step we use a `for of` loop to 
successively add all the numbers to `sum`.
